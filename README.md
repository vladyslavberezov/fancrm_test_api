## Description

First a small clarification , I used forwardRef() only to make 1 method work, but in general this is a bad architecture
and should never be done this way.
Envs included too only for easy use

## Installation

```bash
#install mysql server locally
$ docker-compose up --build
```

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev
```
